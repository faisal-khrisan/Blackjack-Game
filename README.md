# Blackjack-Game
This Python app implements a simplified version of the classic card game Blackjack (also known as 21). The game allows the player to draw cards and compete against the dealer to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player can choose to draw additional cards or pass, and the dealer follows a set of rules to determine their moves.
# Features:
* Card Drawing: The player and dealer are dealt two initial cards. The player can choose to draw additional cards.

* Dealer Rules: The dealer must draw cards until their hand value is at least 17.

# Winning Conditions:

* The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21.

* The player loses if their hand value exceeds 21 or the dealer's hand value is closer to 21.

* The game is a draw if both the player and dealer have the same hand value.

* Interactive Interface: The player can choose to continue playing or exit after each game.
  
* Clear Screen: Clears the screen between games for a fresh interface.
